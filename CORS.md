#### What is CORS?

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows web applications to request resources from a different domain than the one that served the web page. For example, if a web page from `example.com` tries to make a request to `api.example.com`, CORS policies will determine whether the browser will allow this request.

#### Why is CORS Needed?

By default, web browsers enforce a security feature called the same-origin policy. This policy restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the original web page. The same-origin policy is a critical security mechanism for isolating potentially malicious documents, reducing the potential for various types of attacks.

CORS provides a way to relax this strict policy, allowing servers to specify which domains are permitted to access their resources.

#### Setting `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to `*`

When the server sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to `*`, it indicates that any domain can access the resource. This is the most permissive CORS policy and allows unrestricted cross-origin requests.

`return JSONResponse(content=specialities_document, headers={"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"})`

In the code snippet, this line sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to `*` in the response. Here's what this does:

1. **Allows Any Domain**: By setting this header to `*`, the server tells the browser that it can accept requests from any domain. This is useful for APIs intended to be publicly accessible by any client, regardless of its origin.
2. **Facilitates Cross-Origin Requests**: This setting is particularly important in web applications that use JavaScript to make AJAX requests to a server. If the server did not include this header or included a more restrictive value, the browser would block the request if it originated from a different domain than the server.

### Example Scenario

#### Without `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

Suppose you have a web page hosted at `https://example.com` and it tries to make an AJAX request to `https://api.example.com/get_specialities`. If the server at `api.example.com` does not include the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in its response, the browser will block the request, and you'll see an error like this in the browser's console:


```c#
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://api.example.com/get_specialities' from origin 'https://example.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.`

```
#### With `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`

By including the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header, the server at `api.example.com` tells the browser that it is okay to make the request from `https://example.com` (or any other domain). The request will succeed, and the web page at `https://example.com` will be able to access the data from `https://api.example.com`.

### Security Considerations

While setting `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to `*` makes the API more accessible, it also opens up the resource to any website. This might be a security concern, particularly if the resource should only be accessed by specific, trusted domains. In such cases, a more restrictive CORS policy should be implemented by specifying allowed domains explicitly, like:


```c#
return JSONResponse(content=specialities_document, headers={"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "https://trusted-domain.com"})
```
This would allow only requests
